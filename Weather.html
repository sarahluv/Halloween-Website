<br/>
<p style="color:orange, font-family: 'Creepster', cursive;font-size:150%">Depending on when in October you are coming, your What to Pack list may vary.

The picture to the right is from our Harlem tour on a mid-October day. Our guests are wearing typical clothing that is appropriate for October.
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Early to Mid October</i>
<ul style="color:orange, font-family: 'Creepster', cursive;font-size:150%">
<li>For men and women, long pants, slacks, and jeans are all good. Light wool or heavy cotton is recommended. For women, heavy leggings or medium weight skirts are fine.</li>
<li>Mostly long-sleeve shirts. Throw in a short-sleeve top for a surprisingly warm day. </li>
<li>A medium weight coat or jacket is necessary. Pack a warm sweater or thick hoodie for layering. </li>
<li>Closed-toe shoes are best – the sandal days of summer are gone. It can’t hurt to have waterproof shoes or boots in case there is a bit of rain.</li>
<li>Having a small umbrella never hurts, though there are many places to buy very cheap umbrellas if the skies turn gray.</li>
</ul>
<i style="color:orange, font-family: 'Creepster', cursive;font-size:150%">Mid to Late October</i> 
<ul style="color:orange, font-family: 'Creepster', cursive;font-size:150%">
<li>The same items above, but made of a warmer material such as wool or heavy cotton. </li>
<li>Sweaters are cozy for layering.</li>
<li>If you tend to get cold easily, bring a light scarf. </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p style="color:orange, font-family: 'Creepster', cursive;font-size:150%">If you find out too late you didn’t pack correctly, you can pick up some cool clothes on one of our shopping tours.  You could also go to the outlets in Woodbury Commons and get a load of discount designer fall clothing.
